# R2D2 ROS2 Package

This will be used to control my R2D2 using ROS2.  My plan is to have a package for each feature.  Then you can utilize those features only.  Most of the packages will utilize a Raspberry Pi 3 board.  This is cheap to buy and control most hardware like servos and motor controllers.

## Build

``` bash
colcon build
source .install/setup.bash
```
